# ZeZo Movies App

## Using Ad Blocker (Optional)

Some of the video streams (e.g., Vidsrc) may display ads or popups.  
For the best viewing experience, we recommend using a browser with an ad blocker.  

### Recommended Options:
- **[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)** – Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge.  
- **[AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)** – Works on most browsers.  
- **Brave Browser** – Built-in ad blocking, no extension needed.  

### Steps:
1. Install an ad blocker of your choice.  
2. Open the app via your Netlify link:  https://zezomovies.netlify.app/
3. Enjoy the content with most popups and ads blocked.

> ⚠️ Note: While ad blockers reduce popups, some ads inside embedded players may still appear. For a fully ad-free experience, official streaming providers are recommended.
